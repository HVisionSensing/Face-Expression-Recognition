This is my project for CSC2515 at UofT, please feel free to use

1. Use Xcode to run the program.
2. Add related frameworks from directory "$(SRCROOT)/opencv-2.4.5/release/lib"
3. Add Header Search Path with "$(SRCROOT)/opencv-2.4.5/release/include"
4. !IMPORTANT set C++ Standard Library to "libstdc++(GNU C++ standard library"
5. Edit scheme to put "<some path>/dataset.csv" into the environment argument
6. Edit scheme to properly set the working directory

- Directory also contains a compiled opencv-2.4.5. 
- A dataset is provides, call JAFFE, in the folder "DataSet", accompanied with a script to generate the csv file.
- Ideas are not new, derived from the papers provided.
- Just add frameworks from directory "./release/lib" 
- And add Header Search Path with "./release/include"
